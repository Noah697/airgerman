                We are excited to announce the introduction of the Airbus A350 to our fleet! This milestone marks a significant expansion as we welcome the highly anticipated <strong>iniBuilds A350</strong> – the first A350 available for Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS).
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, the A350 will be available exclusively for <strong>MSFS 2020</strong>. We anticipate making it accessible for <strong>MSFS 2024</strong> in the coming weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our new A350 fleet consists of the following aircraft:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>D-AOIU "München"</strong> – Airbus A350-900, stationed in <strong>Munich (EDDM)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>D-AOIV "Frankfurt"</strong> – Airbus A350-900, stationed in <strong>Frankfurt (EDDF)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>D-AOIW "Berlin"</strong> – Airbus A350-1000, stationed in <strong>Berlin (EDDB)</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Today, we will be flying these new aircraft from <strong>Toulouse (LFBO)</strong> to their new homes in Germany. This special delivery flight marks the beginning of a new chapter for Air German Virtual – and we are excited to share this journey with you!
            </p>

            <p>
                The Airbus A350 is one of the most advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft in the world. Its innovative design and lightweight composite materials allow it to consume <strong>up to 25% less fuel</strong> compared to older aircraft models. With its <strong>ultra-quiet Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines</strong> and state-of-the-art aerodynamics, the A350 offers pilots an unmatched flying experience. Its advanced cockpit systems, enhanced flight controls, and cutting-edge avionics make it a dream to operate.
